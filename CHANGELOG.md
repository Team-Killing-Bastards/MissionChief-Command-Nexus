## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added exact Armed Response mission matching for `Required Armed Response Personnel (In Armed Vehicles)`, using type-25 Armed Traffic Cars with two personnel who each hold both Roads Policing and Firearms.
- Expanded the one-click Personnel Register builder to every station type and every discovered vehicle, reading each vehicle's own assignment page before recording trained personnel.
- Added strict Seagoing Vessel matching for ALB/ABL and All-weather Lifeboat display variants.

### Changed

- Changed the Medical Critical Care assignment target from two trained personnel to one trained person per normal Ambulance, including Preview, Live, target planning, shortfall and reporting calculations.
- Police Officer mission-upgrade rows now convert at two officers per normal Police IRV before Unit Finder, Mission Update or Auto Mode selects vehicles.
- Mission Finder baseline increased from `V10.6.72` to `V10.6.73`; Personnel Assignment increased from `1.2.8` to `1.2.9`.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue #42 by stopping the Personnel Assignment Tool from planning or assigning a second unnecessary Critical Care-trained person to each Ambulance.
- Fixed issue #30 by restoring Armed Response Personnel selection through dual-trained Armed Traffic Cars without excluding officers who also hold Firearms training.
- Fixed live upgrade rows such as `Police Officers x8` selecting eight IRVs instead of four.
- Fixed Seagoing Vessel upgrade rows falling through generic text matching instead of selecting an exact ALB/ABL vehicle.
- Fixed the register builder copying a single vehicle-page snapshot across a station instead of recording exact vehicle assignments.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added a one-click **Build Personnel Register** action that scans Police, Police Aviation and EOD stations without changing staffing assignments or requiring profile, mode, action or start-point setup.
- Added exact trained-IRV mission selection for **Police Medic** and **Railway Police Officer**, using two correctly trained personnel per IRV.

### Changed

- Ordinary Police Car attendance now accepts a freshly verified exact IRV with zero protected specialist qualifications even when no personnel are permanently bound to that vehicle.
- Mission Finder baseline increased from `V10.6.71` to `V10.6.72`; Personnel Assignment increased from `1.2.7` to `1.2.8`.

### Fixed

- Fixed ordinary Police Cars being rejected by Unit Finder, Mission Update and Auto Mode solely because their assignment page reported zero permanent bindings.
- Fixed issue #16 by mapping Police Medic requirement rows and Missing Personnel text to exact IRVs containing two `police_medic`-trained personnel.
- Added Railway Police Officer parsing for both table and alert layouts, selecting exact type-8 IRVs containing two `railway_police`-trained personnel.
- Added an authoritative type-30 ATV Carrier matcher, including `ATV Carrier`, `ATV` and `ATC Carrier` display aliases without matching Police Armed Traffic Cars.
- Prevented incomplete or structurally invalid assignment-page scans from overwriting or authorising specialist-training decisions.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Auto Mode now activates every visible MissionChief `missing_vehicles_load` control before Unit Finder begins selecting vehicles.
- Increased the unified userscript version from `1.0.3` to `1.0.4` and the Mission Finder baseline from `V10.6.70` to `V10.6.71`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Auto Mode waiting on the `Vehicle display limited! Load more vehicles!` bar without clicking it.
- Added sequential `offset_page` loading so every additional vehicle page is requested, not only the first page.
- Added per-page progress checks using the vehicle ID and row-count signature, control replacement and loading-indicator state.
- Unit selection now starts only after the final load control has disappeared and the complete vehicle list remains stable.
- Loading fails closed when the mission changes, the control cannot be clicked, no progress occurs or the bounded timeout is reached.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Normal Police Car and Police Officer attendance now uses only exact-ID IRVs live-verified with assigned staff and no protected specialist Police training.
- Auto Mode and the manual Unit Finder/Mission Update paths now wait for a complete, non-zero, ID-stable vehicle list after loading finishes before selecting units.
- Increased the unified userscript version from `1.0.2` to `1.0.3`.

### Fixed

- Prevented Level 1, Level 2, Sergeant, Medic, Inspector and other specialist-trained Police IRVs from satisfying ordinary Police attendance requirements.
- Prevented an ordinary Police group-button fallback from bypassing exact vehicle training protection.
- Prevented Auto Mode from continuing to selection or dispatch when the vehicle list times out, remains empty or is still changing.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Adds verified GitHub, Greasy Fork and Discord deployment notifications. This release tests the complete automated publication and validation process without changing MissionChief runtime behaviour.
- Increased the unified userscript version from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Increased the unified userscript version from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` without functional changes.
- Confirmed the canonical `main`-branch source synchronization path used for external distribution.

- One standardized userscript metadata block naming MartyBlyth as author.
- Mission Finder `V10.6.69` baseline.
- Unit, Station & Personnel Tools `V4.2.8` baseline.

- Greasy Fork synchronization, rollback and troubleshooting guidance.
- Contribution, support, security and community policies.

Release notes should describe user-visible behaviour, migration impact, tested environments and known limitations rather than commit history alone.
